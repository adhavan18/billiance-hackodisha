ðŸ“Œ overview

billiance is an ai-powered shoplifting detection system that leverages computer vision and machine learning to enhance retail security. by monitoring cctv footage in real-time, the system assigns confidence scores to customer-product interactions and detects suspicious activities, such as product concealment or unauthorized removal. when potential shoplifting is identified, an email alert with video evidence is immediately sent to the shopkeeper.

ðŸš€ features
